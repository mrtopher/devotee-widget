# devot:ee Widget for dashEE

If you use the [dashEE ExpressionEngine module](https://github.com/mrtopher/dashEE) and sell add-ons using [devot:ee](http://devot-ee.com) then this widget is for you. This widget displays a summary of all the sales you've made through devot:ee within the last 30 days displaying the add-ons name, date of sale and price paid.

## Installation

Place the wgt.devotee.php file in the widgets folder of the dashEE module in your /system/expressionengine/third_party folder.

That's it. When you click the Widgets button from the dashboard you should now see the widget listed as an option.

## Updating

When updating the widget it is recommended that you first remove the widget from your dashboard, upload the updated widget file and then re-add the widget. If you don't do things in this order you may experience unexpected results. One remedy may be to remove and re-add the widget once the updated file has been uploaded.
